        <h1>prints</h1>

        <p>if you're a collector of my digital art and interested in having a fine art print made of your piece, you're in the right place :)</p>

        <p>please note that if you want a print of a work of mine that you own for your own display purposes as a collector, you always can get it printed yourself with a local print shop without needing my permission to do so based on the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC license</a> that I use for my work</p>

        <p>that said, if you would like to purchase prints from me directly, I am currently offering two print varieties: limited edition prints of tokens from my <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/user/0xffbc92e11575fe4da9093f53957956d991c78268" target="_blank">Art Blocks releases</a>, and open edition composite prints of my <a href="https://robotlovecoffee.wtf/Artist/stipple/Cards" target="_blank">stippled Pepe cards</a></p>

        <h2>limited edition prints</h2>

        <img src="img/preserves.png" alt="Triptych of works across Stippled Sunsets, Patchwork Saguaros, and Speckled Summits.">

        <p>for collectors of one of my generative art projects released via Art Blocks, I offer limited edition hand signed archival quality prints in two (large) sizes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>24in x 24in — 300 <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/" target="_blank">DAI</a></li>
            <li>36in x 36in — 400 <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/" target="_blank">DAI</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>these prints are limited in edition to token holders, but not limited in total edition size — if you sell your digital token, a future owner may purchase their own signed print from me of the same token ID #</p>

        <p>please note that in the process of purchasing one of these signed prints, I will ask that you prove token ownership by sending me a signed message with your token ID, using <a href="https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures#" target="_blank">Etherscan's verified signatures app</a></p>

        <p>to start an order please send an email to <a href="mailto:jake@stipplestudio.art" target="_blank">jake@stipplestudio.art</a> with: your name, mailing address, email, the token ID(s) you would like printed, the size(s) you would like, and whether you prefer to pay in DAI or ETH.</p>
